Short, practical, and macro-friendly. Save this base and remix flavors next time.

## Tips
- Add 1–2 tbsp Greek yogurt for body.
- Allulose stays softer than erythritol in frozen treats.
- Re-spin with 1–2 tbsp milk if crumbly.

## Variations
- Swap whey for a whey/casein blend to improve texture.
- Use allulose for softer freeze; erythritol sets harder.
- Add 1–2 tbsp nonfat Greek yogurt for creaminess.
- Stir in mix-ins after the first spin (chips, berries, cookie crumbles).

## Troubleshooting
**Crumbly after first spin.** Add 1–2 tbsp milk and re-spin. Casein/blend proteins help bind water.
**Icy texture.** Use allulose, add a spoon of yogurt or pudding mix, and avoid over-freezing pints for days.

## FAQs
**Which protein is best for Creami?**

A whey/casein blend or casein alone gives thicker, less icy results than pure whey isolate.
**How do I sweeten without aftertaste?**

Try allulose or a blend of allulose + a few drops of liquid stevia.
