Short, practical, and macro-friendly. Save this base and remix flavors next time.

## Tips
- Allulose stays softer than erythritol in frozen treats.
- Casein or whey/casein blends reduce iciness.
- Cocoa + instant espresso = richer chocolate.

## Variations
- Swap whey for a whey/casein blend to improve texture.
- Use allulose for softer freeze; erythritol sets harder.
- Add 1–2 tbsp nonfat Greek yogurt for creaminess.
- Stir in mix-ins after the first spin (chips, berries, cookie crumbles).

## Troubleshooting
**Won’t release from molds.** Run the mold under warm water 10–15 seconds, then twist gently.
**Too icy.** Blend longer to fully dissolve protein and sweetener; use allulose for softer bite.

## FAQs
**Can I use whey isolate?**

Yes, but the texture may be icier. A whey-casein blend or adding 1–2 tbsp Greek yogurt helps.
**How do I sweeten without aftertaste?**

Try allulose or a blend of allulose + a few drops of liquid stevia.
