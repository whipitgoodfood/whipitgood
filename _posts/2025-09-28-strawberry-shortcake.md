Short, practical, and macro-friendly. Save this base and remix flavors next time.

## Tips
- Allulose stays softer than erythritol in frozen treats.
- For extra creaminess, add 1 tbsp sugar-free pudding mix.
- Casein or whey/casein blends reduce iciness.

## Variations
- Swap whey for a whey/casein blend to improve texture.
- Use allulose for softer freeze; erythritol sets harder.
- Add 1–2 tbsp nonfat Greek yogurt for creaminess.
- Stir in mix-ins after the first spin (chips, berries, cookie crumbles).

## Troubleshooting
**Crumbly after first spin.** Add 1–2 tbsp milk and re-spin. Casein/blend proteins help bind water.
**Icy texture.** Use allulose, add a spoon of yogurt or pudding mix, and avoid over-freezing pints for days.

## FAQs
**How do I avoid icy pops?**

Blend longer to fully dissolve protein and sweetener; use allulose for a softer bite.
**Can I use whey isolate?**

Yes, but the texture may be icier. A whey-casein blend or adding 1–2 tbsp Greek yogurt helps.
