Short, practical, and macro-friendly. Save this base and remix flavors next time.

## Tips
- Chilling the base before freezing improves texture.
- A pinch of salt boosts sweetness and flavor.
- Don’t pack protein powder—level the scoop.

## Variations
- Swap whey for a whey/casein blend to improve texture.
- Use allulose for softer freeze; erythritol sets harder.
- Add 1–2 tbsp nonfat Greek yogurt for creaminess.
- Stir in mix-ins after the first spin (chips, berries, cookie crumbles).

## Troubleshooting
**Muted spice flavor.** Increase spice 1/4 tsp at a time; salt amplifies sweetness and flavor.

## FAQs
**How do I sweeten without aftertaste?**

Try allulose or a blend of allulose + a few drops of liquid stevia.
**Can I swap almond milk for dairy?**

Yes. 2% milk makes a creamier result; adjust sweetness to taste.
