Short, practical, and macro-friendly. Save this base and remix flavors next time.

## Tips
- Chilling the base before freezing improves texture.
- Allulose stays softer than erythritol in frozen treats.
- Don’t pack protein powder—level the scoop.

## Variations
- Swap whey for a whey/casein blend to improve texture.
- Use allulose for softer freeze; erythritol sets harder.
- Add 1–2 tbsp nonfat Greek yogurt for creaminess.
- Stir in mix-ins after the first spin (chips, berries, cookie crumbles).

## Troubleshooting
**Muted spice flavor.** Increase spice 1/4 tsp at a time; salt amplifies sweetness and flavor.

## FAQs
**How do I avoid icy pops?**

Blend longer to fully dissolve protein and sweetener; use allulose for a softer bite.
**Which protein is best for Creami?**

A whey/casein blend or casein alone gives thicker, less icy results than pure whey isolate.
