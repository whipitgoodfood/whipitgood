Short, practical, and macro-friendly. Save this base and remix flavors next time.

## Tips
- Stir in mix-ins after the first spin.
- A pinch of salt boosts sweetness and flavor.
- Chilling the base before freezing improves texture.

## Variations
- Swap whey for a whey/casein blend to improve texture.
- Use allulose for softer freeze; erythritol sets harder.
- Add 1–2 tbsp nonfat Greek yogurt for creaminess.
- Stir in mix-ins after the first spin (chips, berries, cookie crumbles).

## Troubleshooting
**Dry texture.** Reduce bake time 2–3 minutes, add 1–2 tbsp yogurt, or use a whey/casein blend.
**Rubbery crumb.** Avoid over-mixing once wet ingredients are added; use cocoa/oat flour balance.

## FAQs
**Which protein is best for Creami?**

A whey/casein blend or casein alone gives thicker, less icy results than pure whey isolate.
**Is Greek yogurt required?**

It helps creaminess and protein. For dairy-free, try coconut yogurt or silken tofu.
