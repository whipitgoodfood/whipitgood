Short, practical, and macro-friendly. Save this base and remix flavors next time.

## Tips
- Don’t pack protein powder—level the scoop.
- Add 1–2 tbsp Greek yogurt for body.
- Casein or blend proteins make thicker, less icy results.

## Variations
- Swap whey for a whey/casein blend to improve texture.
- Use allulose for softer freeze; erythritol sets harder.
- Add 1–2 tbsp nonfat Greek yogurt for creaminess.
- Stir in mix-ins after the first spin (chips, berries, cookie crumbles).

## Troubleshooting
**Muted spice flavor.** Increase spice 1/4 tsp at a time; salt amplifies sweetness and flavor.

## FAQs
**Is Greek yogurt required?**

It helps creaminess and protein. For dairy-free, try coconut yogurt or silken tofu.
**How do I avoid icy pops?**

Blend longer to fully dissolve protein and sweetener; use allulose for a softer bite.
