Short, practical, and macro-friendly. Save this base and remix flavors next time.

## Tips
- Cocoa + instant espresso = richer chocolate.
- Allulose stays softer than erythritol in frozen treats.
- For extra creaminess, add 1 tbsp sugar-free pudding mix.

## Variations
- Swap whey for a whey/casein blend to improve texture.
- Use allulose for softer freeze; erythritol sets harder.
- Add 1–2 tbsp nonfat Greek yogurt for creaminess.
- Stir in mix-ins after the first spin (chips, berries, cookie crumbles).

## Troubleshooting
**Won’t release from molds.** Run the mold under warm water 10–15 seconds, then twist gently.
**Too icy.** Blend longer to fully dissolve protein and sweetener; use allulose for softer bite.

## FAQs
**Is Greek yogurt required?**

It helps creaminess and protein. For dairy-free, try coconut yogurt or silken tofu.
**How do I avoid icy pops?**

Blend longer to fully dissolve protein and sweetener; use allulose for a softer bite.
