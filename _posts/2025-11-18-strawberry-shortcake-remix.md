Short, practical, and macro-friendly. Save this base and remix flavors next time.

## Tips
- Chilling the base before freezing improves texture.
- Cocoa + instant espresso = richer chocolate.
- Don’t pack protein powder—level the scoop.

## Variations
- Swap whey for a whey/casein blend to improve texture.
- Use allulose for softer freeze; erythritol sets harder.
- Add 1–2 tbsp nonfat Greek yogurt for creaminess.
- Stir in mix-ins after the first spin (chips, berries, cookie crumbles).

## Troubleshooting
**Crumbly after first spin.** Add 1–2 tbsp milk and re-spin. Casein/blend proteins help bind water.
**Icy texture.** Use allulose, add a spoon of yogurt or pudding mix, and avoid over-freezing pints for days.

## FAQs
**Can I swap almond milk for dairy?**

Yes. 2% milk makes a creamier result; adjust sweetness to taste.
**How do I sweeten without aftertaste?**

Try allulose or a blend of allulose + a few drops of liquid stevia.
