Short, practical, and macro-friendly. Save this base and remix flavors next time.

## Tips
- Cocoa + instant espresso = richer chocolate.
- Casein or blend proteins make thicker, less icy results.
- A pinch of salt boosts sweetness and flavor.

## Variations
- Swap whey for a whey/casein blend to improve texture.
- Use allulose for softer freeze; erythritol sets harder.
- Add 1–2 tbsp nonfat Greek yogurt for creaminess.
- Stir in mix-ins after the first spin (chips, berries, cookie crumbles).

## Troubleshooting
**Dry texture.** Reduce bake time 2–3 minutes, add 1–2 tbsp yogurt, or use a whey/casein blend.
**Rubbery crumb.** Avoid over-mixing once wet ingredients are added; use cocoa/oat flour balance.

## FAQs
**Can I swap almond milk for dairy?**

Yes. 2% milk makes a creamier result; adjust sweetness to taste.
**Can I make it dairy-free?**

Use a plant protein you like and swap Greek yogurt for coconut yogurt or silken tofu.
