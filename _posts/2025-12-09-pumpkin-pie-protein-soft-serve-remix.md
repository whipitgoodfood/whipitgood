Short, practical, and macro-friendly. Save this base and remix flavors next time.

## Tips
- Add 1–2 tbsp Greek yogurt for body.
- For softer texture, use allulose instead of erythritol.
- Casein or whey/casein blends reduce iciness.

## Variations
- Swap whey for a whey/casein blend to improve texture.
- Use allulose for softer freeze; erythritol sets harder.
- Add 1–2 tbsp nonfat Greek yogurt for creaminess.
- Stir in mix-ins after the first spin (chips, berries, cookie crumbles).

## Troubleshooting
**Muted spice flavor.** Increase spice 1/4 tsp at a time; salt amplifies sweetness and flavor.

## FAQs
**Can I make it dairy-free?**

Use a plant protein you like and swap Greek yogurt for coconut yogurt or silken tofu.
**Can I use whey isolate?**

Yes, but the texture may be icier. A whey-casein blend or adding 1–2 tbsp Greek yogurt helps.
