Short, practical, and macro-friendly. Save this base and remix flavors next time.

## Tips
- Casein or blend proteins make thicker, less icy results.
- Chill bowls/spoons to slow melting in summer.
- Allulose stays softer than erythritol in frozen treats.

## Variations
- Swap whey for a whey/casein blend to improve texture.
- Use allulose for softer freeze; erythritol sets harder.
- Add 1–2 tbsp nonfat Greek yogurt for creaminess.
- Stir in mix-ins after the first spin (chips, berries, cookie crumbles).

## Troubleshooting
**Won’t release from molds.** Run the mold under warm water 10–15 seconds, then twist gently.
**Too icy.** Blend longer to fully dissolve protein and sweetener; use allulose for softer bite.

## FAQs
**Best sweetener for baking?**

Allulose or a blend; erythritol can crystallize.
**Can I make it dairy-free?**

Use a plant protein you like and swap Greek yogurt for coconut yogurt or silken tofu.
