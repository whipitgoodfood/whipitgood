Short, practical, and macro-friendly. Save this base and remix flavors next time.

## Tips
- Add 1–2 tbsp Greek yogurt for body.
- For softer texture, use allulose instead of erythritol.
- Re-spin with 1–2 tbsp milk if crumbly.

## Variations
- Swap whey for a whey/casein blend to improve texture.
- Use allulose for softer freeze; erythritol sets harder.
- Add 1–2 tbsp nonfat Greek yogurt for creaminess.
- Stir in mix-ins after the first spin (chips, berries, cookie crumbles).

## Troubleshooting
**Dry texture.** Reduce bake time 2–3 minutes, add 1–2 tbsp yogurt, or use a whey/casein blend.
**Rubbery crumb.** Avoid over-mixing once wet ingredients are added; use cocoa/oat flour balance.

## FAQs
**Is Greek yogurt required?**

It helps creaminess and protein. For dairy-free, try coconut yogurt or silken tofu.
**How do I sweeten without aftertaste?**

Try allulose or a blend of allulose + a few drops of liquid stevia.
