Short, practical, and macro-friendly. Save this base and remix flavors next time.

## Tips
- Re-spin with 1–2 tbsp milk if crumbly.
- Allulose stays softer than erythritol in frozen treats.
- Casein or blend proteins make thicker, less icy results.

## Variations
- Swap whey for a whey/casein blend to improve texture.
- Use allulose for softer freeze; erythritol sets harder.
- Add 1–2 tbsp nonfat Greek yogurt for creaminess.
- Stir in mix-ins after the first spin (chips, berries, cookie crumbles).

## Troubleshooting
**Crumbly after first spin.** Add 1–2 tbsp milk and re-spin. Casein/blend proteins help bind water.
**Icy texture.** Use allulose, add a spoon of yogurt or pudding mix, and avoid over-freezing pints for days.

## FAQs
**Can I make it dairy-free?**

Use a plant protein you like and swap Greek yogurt for coconut yogurt or silken tofu.
**Can I use collagen instead of whey?**

Collagen won’t thicken the same; mix with whey or add pudding mix.
