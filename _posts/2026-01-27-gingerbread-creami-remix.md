Short, practical, and macro-friendly. Save this base and remix flavors next time.

## Tips
- For extra creaminess, add 1 tbsp sugar-free pudding mix.
- Add 1–2 tbsp Greek yogurt for body.
- Add sugar-free pudding mix for extra creaminess.

## Variations
- Swap whey for a whey/casein blend to improve texture.
- Use allulose for softer freeze; erythritol sets harder.
- Add 1–2 tbsp nonfat Greek yogurt for creaminess.
- Stir in mix-ins after the first spin (chips, berries, cookie crumbles).

## Troubleshooting
**Muted spice flavor.** Increase spice 1/4 tsp at a time; salt amplifies sweetness and flavor.

## FAQs
**Can I make it dairy-free?**

Use a plant protein you like and swap Greek yogurt for coconut yogurt or silken tofu.
**Can I use collagen instead of whey?**

Collagen won’t thicken the same; mix with whey or add pudding mix.
