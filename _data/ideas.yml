faq:
  - q: "Can I swap almond milk for dairy?"
    a: "Yes. 2% milk makes a creamier result; adjust sweetness to taste."
  - q: "Can I use collagen instead of whey?"
    a: "Collagen won’t thicken the same; mix with whey or add pudding mix."
  - q: "How do I avoid icy pops?"
    a: "Blend longer to fully dissolve protein and sweetener; use allulose for a softer bite."
  - q: "Is Greek yogurt required?"
    a: "It helps creaminess and protein. For dairy-free, try coconut yogurt or silken tofu."
  - q: "Which protein is best for Creami?"
    a: "A whey/casein blend or casein alone gives thicker, less icy results than pure whey isolate."
