tips:
  - For softer texture, use allulose instead of erythritol.
  - Casein or whey/casein blends reduce iciness.
  - Add 1–2 tbsp Greek yogurt for body.
  - A pinch of salt boosts sweetness and flavor.
  - Chilling the base before freezing improves texture.
  - Cocoa + instant espresso = richer chocolate.
  - Add pudding mix (sugar-free) for extra creaminess.
  - Re-spin with 1–2 tbsp milk if crumbly.
  - Don’t pack protein powder—level scoop for consistency.
  - Stir in mix-ins after the first spin for better distribution.

faq:
  - q: Can I swap almond milk for dairy?
    a: Yes. 2% milk makes a creamier result; adjust sweetness to taste.
  - q: Can I use collagen instead of whey?
    a: Collagen won’t thicken the same; mix with whey or add pudding mix.
  - q: How do I avoid icy pops?
    a: Blend longer to fully dissolve protein and sweetener; use allulose for a softer bite.
  - q: Is Greek yogurt required?
    a: It helps creaminess and protein. For dairy-free, try coconut yogurt or silken tofu.
  - q: Which protein is best for Creami?
    a: A whey/casein blend or casein alone gives thicker, less icy results than pure whey isolate.
